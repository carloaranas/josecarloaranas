            <h4>3D Bioprinting / Tissue Engineering</h4>
            <p>3D Bioprinting is a process wherein bioprinters can print cells and biomaterials, which enables us to create organs and other similar structures that let live cells multiply.</p>
           
            <p>The leading tissue engineering company is <strong>Organovo</strong>, which is based on San Diego, California. The company has been actively developing tissues for medical and drug research and discoveries.</p>
            
            <h5>Beneficiaries:</h5>
            <p>This technology is beneficial to patients who need cell and organ transplants. With the help of Bioprinting, not only it lowers the need of organ donors, it also reduces the chances of cell rejection in the patient's body, as well as the expenses of the surgery.</p>
