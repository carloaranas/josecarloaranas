    <p>As Javascript was implemented in the ECMAScript in 1997, Javascript became the most popular implementation for web standards and functionalities. The prosperity of Ecmascript continued for a couple of years, enabling them to release subsequent versions of the language. This, although, did not last that long since in 2000, Internet Explorer shoot its way up in the browser market, which Windows made very clear to not implement proper Javascript. It was then after how many years that ECMAScript continued to be published. Despite it became inactive for many years, the community still continued to support ECMAScript and it became the language of the web in 2009. Developers now also respected the language, which then resulted in a huge engagement in the community. It also became a language used in developing frameworks, and upgraded as well to not only be a browser-specific language, but a server-side language as well. As time pass by, Javascript became very popular and is still one of the go to languages of developers when it comes to web development.</p>
    <p>I believe Javascript will come a long way as we continue to develop more browsers and applications from time to time. As this language would continue to improve its functionalities and capabilities, I believe that the future of Javascript would be very successful, and it would be a language that will have the ability to answer modern world problems in web development.</p>
